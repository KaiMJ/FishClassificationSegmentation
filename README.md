# Fish Classification and Segmentation Module

## Using Pretrained Resnet and Unet, classified and segmented a large scale fish dataset.

- Classified nine distinct species of fishes widely consumed in the Aegean Region of Turkey to help avoid spoilage which cause severe human health problems and economic loss.
- Annotated the fish images to help process the fishes quickly and more efficiently. 
- Created a Jupyter Notebook to display the type of models used and visualize the images.
